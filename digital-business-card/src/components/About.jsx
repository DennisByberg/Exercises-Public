        <p>
          I am a frontend developer with a particular interest in making things
          simple and automating daily tasks. I try to keep up with security and
          best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn.

        <label>Interests</label>
        <p>
          I love playing football, working out, programming and spending time
          with my cats and my partner.
